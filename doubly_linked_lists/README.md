Doubly linked lists are similar to singly linked lists yet are traversable frontwards and backwards.
Both are made of structs, most, likely typedef'ed for convenience. They have atleast three members for doubly linked, data type, next *ptr, prev *ptr. Head and tail will both have a NULL value.

Prototypes and struct included in lists.h file.
