This is one of those times when documentation would be great, but I'm exhuasted. This should describe each function's purpose.
_isupper - a function that checks for uppercase character
_memset - fills memory with a constant byte
_strcat - concat string
_isdigit- checks for a digit between 0-9
_memcpy - copies n bytes from one area to another
_strncat - does not need to be null if >= n
_atoi - a funtion that converts a string to an integer
_strchr - locate char in string
_strlen - returns string length
_strncpy - copies string without nullbyte
_islower - returns 1 for c is lowercase check
 _puts - prints a string followed by new line
_strcmp - compare two strings
_strspn - gets initial segment which consists of specific bytes
_isalpha - check if input c is an alphabet
 _strpbrk - finds first char in string *s1 that matches any char in *s2
_strstr - finds first occurance between two substrings
_abs - print the absolute value of an integer
_strcpy - cp pointed string, inc \0, to buffer dest
_putchar - writes the character c to stdout
